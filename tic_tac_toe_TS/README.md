The Tic Tac Toe Game is a simple web application that allows two players to play the classic game of Tic Tac Toe. It keeps track of the players' scores using local storage.

# Getting Started
To play the Tic Tac Toe game, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

# How to Play
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.

Players take turns clicking on an empty cell in the grid to place their respective marks ('X' or 'O').

The player who successfully places three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

If all cells are filled and no player has three marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.

# Scores
The application displays the scores for each player (Player X and Player O) using local storage.

To reset the scores, click the "Clean" button.
